# YouTube Treatment Comparison Helper - Demo Script for Loom

## 🎬 INTRO (0:00 - 0:30)

**Screen**: Show Airtable CSV with multiple video treatment records

**Script**:
> "Hey team! I want to show you the YouTube Treatment Comparison Helper we just built. This Chrome extension automates the painful process of comparing PRE vs POST treatment metrics in YouTube Studio.
>
> Currently, when we make changes to videos - like updating titles, thumbnails, or tags - we manually copy metrics from YouTube Studio into Airtable. This extension automates that entire workflow."

---

## 📊 THE PROBLEM (0:30 - 1:00)

**Screen**: Show the Airtable CSV columns (Pre CTR, Pre Views, Pre AWT, Post CTR, Post Views, Post AWT)

**Script**:
> "Look at this Airtable - we have hundreds of treatment updates. For each one, we need:
> - Pre CTR, Views, AWT, and Consumption
> - Post CTR, Views, AWT, and Consumption
>
> To get this data, you have to:
> 1. Calculate the exact date ranges (days before treatment vs days after)
> 2. Go to YouTube Studio Analytics
> 3. Manually select the custom date range
> 4. Select the right metrics
> 5. Copy each value one by one
> 6. Do it TWICE - once for PRE, once for POST
>
> For 100 videos, that's hours of repetitive work every week."

---

## ✨ THE SOLUTION - PHASE 1: Smart Date Calculation (1:00 - 2:00)

**Screen**: Navigate to YouTube Studio Analytics page

**Script**:
> "Here's how the extension works. First, let me install it..."

**Action**:
- Show chrome://extensions page
- Show the extension installed
- Navigate to YouTube Studio Analytics for any video

**Screen**: Click the "Treatment Comparison" button (top-right)

**Script**:
> "See this purple button at the top? That's our extension. Click it and it opens this panel."

**Action**: Show the panel opening

**Screen**: Enter treatment date (e.g., 16th October 2025)

**Script**:
> "Let's say I made a title change on October 16th. I enter that date here and click 'Calculate Periods'."

**Action**: Click Calculate, show the results

**Screen**: Show PRE and POST date ranges

**Script**:
> "Boom! The extension automatically calculates:
> - PRE period: Same number of days BEFORE the treatment
> - POST period: Treatment date to yesterday
>
> Notice it says 'Days Since Treatment: 5 days'. That means:
> - PRE: 12-15 Oct (4 days before treatment)
> - POST: 16-20 Oct (5 days after, ending yesterday)
>
> This is exactly what we need for fair comparison - equal time periods before and after the change."

---

## 🚀 THE SOLUTION - PHASE 2: Auto-Extraction (2:00 - 4:00)

**Screen**: Scroll down in the panel to show "Auto-Extract Metrics" button

**Script**:
> "Now here's where it gets REALLY good. Instead of manually entering dates and copying metrics, click this button..."

**Action**: Click "Auto-Extract Metrics"

**Screen**: Show the extraction in progress

**Script**:
> "Watch what happens:
> - It automatically selects the right metrics (Views, CTR, AWT, Consumption)
> - Sets the PRE date range (12-15 Oct)
> - Waits for the table to refresh
> - Extracts all 4 metrics
> - Then automatically switches to POST dates (16-20 Oct)
> - Extracts those metrics too
>
> All of this happens in about 10 seconds. No clicking, no typing, no copying."

**Action**: Wait for extraction to complete

**Screen**: Show the results comparison

**Script**:
> "And here's the beautiful part - it shows you both periods side by side:
>
> **PRE Period (12-15 Oct)**:
> - Views: 1,460
> - CTR: 4.0%
> - AWT: 0:52
> - Consumption: 32.5%
>
> **POST Period (16-20 Oct)**:
> - Views: 2,234
> - CTR: 5.2%
> - AWT: 1:08
> - Consumption: 38.7%
>
> You can instantly see that after the treatment, CTR improved by 30%, views went up by 53%, and watch time increased."

**Action**: Click "Copy Metrics to Clipboard"

**Script**:
> "Click this button and all 8 metrics are copied in a format ready to paste into Airtable or a spreadsheet."

## 💡 SMART FEATURES (4:00 - 5:00)

**Screen**: Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar

**Script**:
> "Let me show you some smart features. Click the extension icon..."

**Action**: Show the popup with toggle button

**Script**:
> "This toggle button lets you show or hide the panel. Super useful if you accidentally close it or refresh the page - just click 'Show Panel' and it comes back."

**Action**: Click "Hide Panel", then "Show Panel"

**Screen**: Drag the panel around the screen

**Script**:
> "The panel is also draggable - grab this handle and move it anywhere. Your position is saved, so even if you refresh the page, it stays where you put it."

**Action**: Drag panel to different positions

**Screen**: Show date format adaptation

**Script**:
> "One more thing - it automatically detects your location. In India, it uses DD/MM/YYYY format. In the US, it uses MM/DD/YYYY. YouTube's date picker is picky about formats, so we handle that automatically."

---

## 🧠 TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHT: Smart Date Ordering (5:00 - 6:00)

**Screen**: Open browser console, click "Auto-Extract" again

**Script**:
> "Here's a cool technical detail. Watch the console logs..."

**Action**: Run extraction, show console logs

**Screen**: Point to console showing "Strategy: END first (moving up)"

**Script**:
> "See this? The extension is smart about which date to enter first. YouTube's date picker has validation that rejects changes if you enter dates in the wrong order.
>
> For example:
> - If cached dates are 12-15 and we want 16-20 (moving UP), it sets END first, then START
> - If cached dates are 15-20 and we want 10-14 (moving DOWN), it sets START first, then END
>
> This prevents YouTube from rejecting the input. We discovered this through testing and built in the logic to handle all scenarios automatically."

**Action**: Show second extraction with different strategy in console

**Script**:
> "Look - second extraction uses 'Strategy: START first (moving down)'. It adapts based on the current vs target dates. That's why it works flawlessly every time."

## 🚀 NEXT POSSIBLE STEPS (7:00 - 9:00)

**Screen**: Show the Airtable CSV with all columns

**Script**:
> "Here's what we could add next to make this even more powerful..."

### **Option 1: Direct Airtable Integration**

**Script**:
> "**1. Direct Airtable Integration**
>
> Instead of copying to clipboard, we could:
> - Connect to Airtable API
> - Auto-find the matching video record by URL
> - Fill in all 8 metric columns automatically
> - Update the Modified timestamp
>
> This would be fully hands-off - just click one button and the Airtable updates itself."

### **Option 2: Batch Processing**

**Script**:
> "**2. Batch Processing for Multiple Videos**
>
> Right now it's one video at a time. We could add:
> - Upload a CSV of treatment dates and video URLs
> - Process 10, 20, 50 videos automatically
> - Generate a report with all comparisons
> - Export to CSV or push to Airtable
>
> Imagine updating 100 video records in 10 minutes instead of 10 hours."

### **Option 3: Advanced Analytics**

**Script**:
> "**3. Built-in Analytics Dashboard**
>
> Add a dashboard inside the extension showing:
> - % improvement for each metric
> - Visual charts (before vs after)
> - Statistical significance testing
> - Trend analysis across multiple treatments
> - Best performing treatment types
>
> This would help you understand what changes actually work."

### **Option 4: A/B Testing Support**

**Script**:
> "**4. A/B Testing Tracking**
>
> For thumbnail or title A/B tests, add:
> - Track multiple treatment dates for same video
> - Compare Version A vs Version B metrics
> - Identify winning variations
> - Auto-suggest best practices based on data
>
> YouTube's built-in A/B testing doesn't give you this level of detail."

### **Option 5: Video Library Integration**

**Script**:
> "**5. Video Library Scan**
>
> Instead of processing one video at a time:
> - Scan entire YouTube channel
> - Auto-detect videos with recent changes
> - Suggest treatment dates based on edit history
> - Queue all videos for batch processing
>
> Fully automated - just connect your channel and let it run."

### **Option 6: Scheduled Auto-Updates**

**Script**:
> "**6. Scheduled Background Updates**
>
> Set it and forget it:
> - Extension runs in background on a schedule (daily, weekly)
> - Checks Airtable for records missing POST data
> - Automatically extracts metrics when enough time has passed
> - Updates Airtable without you doing anything
>
> Wake up every Monday to a fully updated Airtable."

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP (9:00 - 9:30)

**Screen**: Show Airtable

**Script**:
> "If I had to pick ONE thing to build next, I'd say **Direct Airtable Integration**.
>
> Why? Because it:
> - Eliminates the last manual step (copy/paste)
> - Makes the workflow truly one-click
> - Prevents human error in data entry
> - Is relatively straightforward to implement
>
> We'd need:
> - Airtable API key (easy to get)
> - Base ID and Table ID (from your Airtable URL)
> - Add a settings page to the extension
> - Map the metric fields to Airtable columns
>
> Estimated time: 2-3 hours of development."

---

## 📝 ALTERNATIVE PATH: Batch Processing First

**Screen**: Show multiple video rows in Airtable

**Script**:
> "Alternatively, if you have a backlog of 100+ videos to process, **Batch Processing** might be more valuable.
>
> You could:
> - Export Update IDs and URLs from Airtable
> - Upload the CSV to the extension
> - Let it run for 30-60 minutes
> - Get a complete results CSV back
> - Import back into Airtable
>
> This is the fastest way to catch up on historical data."

---

## 🏁 WRAP-UP (9:30 - 10:00)

**Screen**: Show the extension in action one more time

**Script**:
> "So to recap - we've built a production-ready Chrome extension that:
>
> ✅ Automates YouTube treatment comparison
> ✅ Saves hours of manual work every week
> ✅ Handles all the edge cases and validation
> ✅ Works reliably across multiple extractions
> ✅ Has a polished, professional UI
>
> Next steps are up to you:
> - Use it as-is for manual workflows
> - Add Airtable integration for full automation
> - Add batch processing for bulk updates
> - Build analytics and insights on top
>
> Let me know which direction you want to take this, and I can start building right away.
