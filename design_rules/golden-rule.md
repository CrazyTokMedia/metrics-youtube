most people are lazy not in a bad way just in this isn't worth my brain power kind of way attention spans are shorter than ever so users should be able to figure things out instantly what's the most important action here what this icon does and where to find more info when people land on a site they bring expectations they expect to see some links they expect buttons to look like buttons they expect text to be readable and icons to make sense the moment you break that expectation you force them to think and that's the enemy Google is probably the purest example of don't make me think you don't even see these other options all you see is one search bar with options to search by text voice or image two buttons search and I'm feeling lucky and that's it it's almost boring but it's not boring it's genius because everyone knows exactly what to do whether you're a kid searching for Superman costume a teenager looking for how to impress girls or a grandparent typing how to use Facebook you get it there's no need for instructions no learning curve and no unnecessary effort but I had an unusual incident with Google Maps maybe I am too stupid to drive but here's what happened I was driving on a new route and following directions on Google Maps the app says continue straight but the road splits ahead into two paths a flyover going straight at a higher level and a flat Road running straight beside the flyover at ground level now I am unsure whether to take the flyover and miss the exit or the Flat Road and end up on a different route exit's coming up half a mile you'd think I could find it yeah yeah I would I would here's an obvious and simple solution the app recognizes the split and provides clear instructions instead of continue straight it says something like take the flyover or take the exit the map Zooms in to clearly show the split with a bold line indicating the correct path and grade outlines for other roads Simplicity isn't about dumbing things down it's about making things so obvious that users don't need to stop and think every click every scroll every field should feel effortless if your user has to pause and ask where's the menu is this a button or just text what happens if I click this then your design has already lost our brain loves patterns navigation at the top or on the side buttons look like buttons rectangles with text a magnifying glass means search a cart icon means checkout these patterns exist for a reason they work when you stick to conventions users feel comfortable they know what to expect so they don't have to think that's why when you install a new software all the primary actions appear in the same place or if you notice all the big and and lengthy contracts ask you to sign at the same place across all pages you might worry that sticking to standard design will make your work boring but trust me it's not boring it's good design the goal isn't to reinvent the wheel just make it roll better confusion kills conversions whether you're designing a hero section A signup form or an entire app constantly ask yourself is this immediately clear would a firsttime user understand what to do next if there's any doubt simplify here's the catch simple designs are harder to make a lot of people think that simple means easy or lazy oh you just added a gray background and a big button that probably took 5 minutes I wish the truth is Simplicity takes work it's much harder to create something Clean and Clear than it is to add a bunch of extra stuff like look at the buttons placement in the software example it's simple for you as a user but the developer went through some additional steps just to make sure the buttons are in the same place on all the pages across all screen sizes Simplicity requires discipline attention to detail and a deep understanding of the user it's not about what you add it's about what you leave out figuring out what to remove while still delivering everything the user needs is incredibly challenging it forces you to think test and iterate constantly simple designs might look effortless but behind the scenes they're the result of countless decisions made with precision and purpose that's why Simplicity isn't just a design Choice it's a skill and it's one of the hardest to master an important distinction simple doesn't mean minimal to the point of being useless if a design is simple or minimal but lacks Essential Elements it's bad design a lot of times you need to pack a lot of elements together so the users can make an informed decision but do you really need three different buttons or could a single clear button be more effective does that fancy animation add value or is it just a distraction every unnecessary thing you remove makes your design clearer and easier to use also please make your text easy to scan use headings and bullet points for key information create visual hierarchies that guide the eye people aren't going to analyze the whole UI and click on the perfect option they will quickly scan the page and click the first reasonable or obvious option and if the solution didn't work out they will go back and try again your job is to make the perfect option the most obvious solution so they don't have to go back that often say you are building an online shoe store you got tough hiking shoes for men cute and fancy ones for the ladies and everything in between from Sports to Casual to formal you got them all that means you got a lot of products and a limited space to show them all that means the users have to click multiple times to get to their preferred option in order for the new users to complete their purchase we need to make those clicks obvious and effortless that's where a user flow diagram comes in it guides the user on the shortest and simplest path to complete their objective let's create a fictional user to map out their Journey David age 24 is looking for a black pair of Oxford shoes for his upcoming job interview so he enters our website and sees three options then four more options five more options and then maybe six or 60 more options depending on your catalog this is where most of the thinking will happen but we want David to have an amazing user experience so we got sorting options and some filters as well after some thinking and filtering David got the shoe he wanted the website didn't force him to log in he can fill the shipping address and pay however he wants this took some clicks but we didn't make him think however some users don't like to go that deep so you need to have a search bar that could eliminate clicks and take them directly to what they are looking for now that you got a simple user flow it's time to design let's start with the main header logo on the top left then those primary links and the search bar and lastly the login button for returning customers now to reach here David will click on men according to our user flow we can show the four main categories like a drop- down menu but our job is to make the process of getting here much easier so let's get rid of this additional layer of complexity and provide a simpler solution this way David can get to the shoes catalog in just two simple and obvious clicks as we discussed earlier this is where most of the thinking will happen so we can't bombard the user with information just a big and beautiful product image with clean and clear typography David can look at all the products their ratings The Brand and styles and lastly the most important detail price but we got a lot of options here that means a lot of thinking so let's help David by adding filters and sorting options as well I think the page is quite scannable now it's easy to find a perfect option without a lot of thinking or going back and forth on the website all right we are almost there just a few more clicks and a bit of thinking to complete this journey but first we need to design the most critical page of this website the page with these two buttons you see David will have some basic expectations here he would want to see images reviews color variations a size picker delivery time and product details so let's make all of this very easy to find and understand first of all some photos in a carousel format to avoid unnecessary scrolling next the most important information product name and pricing let's style it better to add some hierarchy and add the ratings with the underline to tell it's clickable then color variations and size selector to find a perfect match we can automatically get David's zip code and let him know about the delivery notice that we have underlined the clickable text it's these little details that matter talking of details I don't want to add product details here delivery details and buy now belong together and product details aren't going to fit here anyway so let's compromise and add the buttons instead but these buttons are competing for attention so let's add some hierarchy by using a color now we can add the product details without making the design too complicated or distracting from the key actions I don't think this will be considered a minimal design we are showing all the Essential Elements to make an informed decision but at the same time time it's scannable and don't force you to think now a very important question how to convince your boss or client on these decisions or sometimes we get stuck with a bad designer incompetent Dev or a project manager who are too stupid or rigid to get on board here's a solution get them to watch a usability test what is a usability test basically get a Target user to use your app for the first time and ask them to do something specific then ask them to do the same thing on your competition if they are performing better on other apps why would they use yours and if they won't use your app you won't make money your boss will understand that too no matter how rigid they are now bring out the Prototype you have designed and test it with the same user if the new design is performing better than the competition it will get implemented everything follows money
