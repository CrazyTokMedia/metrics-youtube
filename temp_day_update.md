# YouTube Treatment Comparison Helper - Day Updates

## Day 1 Update

Hi Amit,

Completed Day 1 research and exploration for YouTube Treatment Comparison Helper.

Tasks Completed:
1. Research & Discovery
-Analyzed YouTube Studio Advanced Mode page structure
-Documented metrics selection dialog, date picker, and table elements
-Studied how vidIQ and TubeBuddy extensions work
-Identified Chrome Extension approach (no OAuth needed vs API approach)

2. Technical Feasibility Testing
-Tested DOM manipulation on YouTube Studio pages
-Verified we can programmatically click buttons and fill forms
-Confirmed table data is accessible via JavaScript
-Tested on private videos with low views (works perfectly)

3. Requirements Definition
-4 key metrics: Views, CTR, Average Watch Time, Consumption
-PRE/POST date range calculation logic
-Treatment date as the starting point

Key Findings:
-Chrome extension approach is much faster than OAuth API setup
-Can extract metrics directly from YouTube Studio (uses existing login)
-No API quotas or rate limits to worry about
-Works on private videos that APIs can't access

Next Steps:
-Build Phase 1: Manual helper with date range calculator
-Create UI panel that injects into YouTube Studio
-Test date calculation logic

Best,
Siddharth

## Day 2 Update

Hi Amit,

Completed Day 2 work - built and tested Phase 1 prototype.

Tasks Completed:
1. Chrome Extension Setup
-Created Manifest V3 extension structure
-Built content script that injects into YouTube Studio
-Designed collapsible UI panel with toggle button

2. Date Range Calculator (Phase 1)
-Implemented treatment date input
-Built PRE/POST calculation logic:
  -PRE: Same duration before treatment
  -POST: Treatment to today (inclusive)
-Added one-click copy for all dates
-Chrome Storage for persistence

3. UI/UX Design
-Purple gradient matching YouTube Studio aesthetic
-Smooth animations and transitions
-Responsive layout that doesn't interfere with YouTube

Testing Results:
-Loaded extension in Chrome successfully
-Date calculations accurate across multiple test cases
-Copy functionality works on all fields
-UI integrates seamlessly with YouTube Studio

Status:
Phase 1 prototype working. Ready to start Phase 2 automation research.

Next Steps:
-Research automation for metrics extraction
-Test console scripts for clicking dialogs and extracting values
-Build proof-of-concept for automated workflow

Best,
Siddharth

## Day 3 Update

Hi Amit,

Completed Day 3 work - researched and built automation scripts for metrics extraction.

Tasks Completed:
1. DOM Research & Analysis
-Extracted HTML structure of metrics dialog, date picker, and table
-Identified all button IDs and element selectors
-Mapped out the complete user flow for extraction

2. Console Script Development
-Built script to select 4 metrics automatically
-Created date range setter (custom PRE/POST dates)
-Implemented table value extractor
-Combined into complete workflow script

3. Testing & Debugging
-Fixed dialog detection bug (was checking wrong conditions)
-Discovered "Apply vs Close" button issue (Close discards changes)
-Optimized using "Deselect all" button instead of manual unchecking
-Tested on real video with actual 2024 data

Key Results:
-Complete PRE/POST extraction takes ~15 seconds
-Successfully extracts: Views (1), CTR (2.4%), AWT (0:29), Consumption (60.0%)
-Handles "no data" cases gracefully (shows —, 0%)
-Console scripts working perfectly

Challenges Solved:
-Metrics dialog was opening but detection failed (fixed selector)
-Table had 6 metrics instead of 4 (fixed with "Deselect all" approach)
-Changes not saving (was clicking Close instead of Apply)

Status:
Phase 2 automation scripts complete and tested in console.

Next Steps:
-Integrate automation into extension UI
-Add progress indicators and status display
-Build side-by-side comparison view

Best,
Siddharth

## Day 4 Update

Hi Amit,

Completed Day 4 work - integrated automation into extension UI. Extension is now production-ready!

Tasks Completed:
1. UI Integration
-Embedded all automation functions into content.js
-Added "Auto-Extract Metrics" button to panel
-Built real-time status display with progress updates
-Created side-by-side PRE/POST comparison display

2. Features Added
-One-click extraction (no console needed)
-Progress indicators during extraction:
  -"Selecting metrics..."
  -"Setting PRE period..."
  -"Extracting PRE metrics..."
  -"Setting POST period..."
  -"Extracting POST metrics..."
  -"Extraction complete!"
-Color-coded display (red PRE, green POST)
-"Copy All Metrics" button
-Automatic data persistence

3. Testing & Validation
-Tested complete workflow on production YouTube Studio
-Verified all 4 metrics extract correctly
-Tested error handling (wrong page, missing dates, etc.)
-Confirmed ~15 second extraction time

4. Documentation
-Created USER_GUIDE.md with installation instructions
-Created INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md with technical docs
-Added troubleshooting section

Testing Feedback:
-Tested by user on real video
-Feedback: "Omfg it worked so well. This is awesome."

Complete User Flow:
1. Open extension panel
2. Enter treatment date → Calculate periods
3. Navigate to video's Advanced Mode
4. Click "Auto-Extract Metrics"
5. Wait ~15 seconds
6. View side-by-side comparison
7. Copy results

Status:
Phase 1 + Phase 2 complete and production-ready. Extension is fully functional and ready for daily use.

Optional Next Step:
Phase 3 (Airtable integration) if we want automatic cloud syncing. Would add "Save to Airtable" button to sync extracted metrics to Airtable base. Estimated 4 days if needed.

Best,
Siddharth
