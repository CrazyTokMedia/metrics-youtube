3. UI/UX
-Purple gradient design matching YouTube Studio aesthetic
-Smooth animations and transitions
-Works seamlessly without interfering with YouTube Studio

Testing:
-Extension loads correctly on studio.youtube.com

## Day 2 Update

Hi Amit,

Completed Day 2 work on the YouTube Treatment Comparison Helper. Here's what was accomplished:

Tasks Completed:
1. YouTube Analytics Research
-Analyzed Advanced Mode analytics page DOM structure
-Documented metrics selection dialog and date picker elements
-Identified data table structure for value extraction

2. Automation Scripts (Phase 2)
-Built script to select exactly 4 metrics automatically (Views, CTR, AWT, Consumption)
-Created date range setter to programmatically set custom PRE/POST periods
-Implemented value extractor to read metrics from YouTube's table
-Built complete workflow: select metrics → set dates → extract values

3. Testing & Bug Fixes
-Fixed dialog detection issues
-Corrected "Apply vs Close" button bug
-Optimized metric selection using "Deselect all" approach
-Validated on real video with actual data

Key Results:
-Complete PRE/POST extraction takes ~15 seconds
-Successfully extracts all 4 metrics for both periods
-Handles "no data" cases gracefully
-Tested on video with 2024 data: successfully extracted Views (1), CTR (2.4%), AWT (0:29), Consumption (60.0%)

Timeline:
Day 2 of 4-day development sprint. Phase 2 automation complete and tested in console.

Next Steps:
Integrate console automation scripts into the extension UI for seamless one-click extraction.

Best,
Siddharth

-All 4 metrics extracted and displayed correctly
-Extension works seamlessly end-to-end
-Tested by user with feedback: "Omfg it worked so well. This is awesome."

Timeline:
Day 3 of 4-day development sprint. Phase 1 + Phase 2 complete and production-ready.

Deliverables:
-Fully functional Chrome extension
-Automated metrics extraction
-Complete documentation

Status:
Extension is production-ready. Current system is fully functional and ready for use. Phase 3 (Airtable integration) is optional enhancement if we want automatic data syncing to Airtable.

Best,
Siddharth

## Day 4 Plan - Phase 3 (Optional)

Hi Amit,

Planning for Phase 3 (Airtable Integration) if we want to add automatic cloud syncing of extracted metrics.

Proposed Scope:
-Connect extension to Airtable API
-Auto-save extracted metrics to Airtable base
-Track video URL, title, treatment date, and all PRE/POST metrics
-Handle duplicate detection (update vs create)
-Add "Save to Airtable" button in UI

Data to Save:
-Video info: URL, title, ID
-Treatment date
-PRE period: dates + 4 metrics
-POST period: dates + 4 metrics
-Extraction timestamp

Estimated Timeline:
-4 days total (1 day setup, 2 days implementation, 1 day testing)

Questions:
1. Do you have an existing Airtable base for this, or should I create one?
2. Should we support bulk processing (multiple videos at once)?
3. Any additional fields to track (channel name, category, etc.)?

Current Status:
Phase 1 + Phase 2 is complete and working perfectly. Airtable integration is optional - the extension is already fully functional for daily use.

Let me know if you'd like to proceed with Phase 3, or if the current functionality meets the requirements.

Best,
Siddharth
